# 🚀 GitHub + Netlify Deployment Guide

Your outfit finder is ready for GitHub deployment! Follow these steps to get your mobile app live.

## 📋 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)** and sign in
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill out the repository details:**
   - Repository name: `kevins-outfit-finder` (or your choice)
   - Description: `Mobile-friendly outfit browser for Kevin's summer wardrobe`
   - Set to **Public** (so Netlify can access it)
   - **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

## 📤 Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

Copy and run these commands in your terminal (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username):

```bash
# Set the remote repository URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kevins-outfit-finder.git

# Set the main branch
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔗 Step 3: Connect to Netlify

1. **Go to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com)** and sign in (use your GitHub account)
2. **Click "Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**
3. **Choose "GitHub"** as your Git provider
4. **Find and select** your `kevins-outfit-finder` repository
5. **Configure the build settings:**
   - **Base directory:** leave empty
   - **Build command:** `python3 generate_static_site.py`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist`
6. **Click "Deploy site"**

## ⚡ Step 4: Set Up Python for Netlify

Netlify needs to know to use Python 3. Create a runtime configuration:

1. **Wait for the first build to fail** (it will, that's expected)
2. **Go to Site settings** → **Environment variables**
3. **Add this variable:**
   - Key: `PYTHON_VERSION`
   - Value: `3.8`
4. **Go to Deploys** → **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**

## 🎉 Your Site is Live!

Once deployed, you'll get:
- **Live URL:** Something like `https://amazing-site-name.netlify.app`
- **Custom domain option:** You can change the name in site settings
- **Auto-deployment:** Every time you push to GitHub, your site updates!

## 📱 Test Your Mobile Site

Visit your live URL on your phone and you should see:
- ✅ All 76 clothing items browsable
- ✅ Search functionality working
- ✅ Item detail pages with outfit images
- ✅ Mobile-optimized responsive design
- ✅ Fast loading on mobile networks

## 🔄 Future Updates

To update your outfit finder:

1. **Edit your data** locally (e.g., `page_items.json`)
2. **Regenerate the static site:** `python3 generate_static_site.py`
3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update outfit data"
   git push
   ```
4. **Netlify automatically rebuilds** and deploys your updates!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails?
- Make sure `PYTHON_VERSION` is set to `3.8` in environment variables
